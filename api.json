      "summary": "A phenomenon characterized by physical disturbances including object movement, unexplained sounds, and occasional violence, often centered around a specific individual, typically an adolescent. Distinguished from traditional hauntings by its kinetic and interactive nature.",
      "full": "Poltergeist phenomena represent one of the most dramatic forms of alleged paranormal activity, characterized by physical disturbances that include objects moving or being thrown, loud unexplained noises (knocks, raps, bangs), electrical disturbances, temperature fluctuations, and in rare cases physical attacks on witnesses. Unlike traditional hauntings attributed to spirits of the deceased, poltergeist activity typically centers around a specific living person—most commonly an adolescent experiencing emotional or psychological stress. The phenomenon often begins gradually, escalates over weeks or months, and then ceases abruptly. Cases have been documented since ancient times and continue to be reported globally. Explanations range from paranormal (disembodied spirits, demonic entities) to parapsychological (unconscious psychokinesis by the focal person) to skeptical (fraud, misinterpretation, natural causes). The term comes from German 'poltern' (to make noise) and 'geist' (ghost/spirit)."

Police constable Carolyn Heeps witnessed a chair sliding across the floor. Maurice Grosse and Guy Lyon Playfair of the Society for Psychical Research investigated for 18 months, documenting over 1,500 incidents. The case garnered extensive media coverage.

      "description": "The Bell Witch is one of America's most famous poltergeist cases, occurring on the farm of John Bell in Tennessee. The entity called itself 'Kate' and communicated through disembodied voices. Phenomena included object movement, physical attacks (particularly against John Bell and daughter Betsy), apparitions, voices conversing with witnesses, prophecies, and singing. The entity claimed to be the spirit of Kate Batts, a neighbor. Activity escalated over four years, with the entity demonstrating knowledge of events happening elsewhere and speaking in multiple voices simultaneously. John Bell's death in 1820 was attributed to poison allegedly administered by the entity. The witch claimed responsibility and promised to return in 107 years. The case gained regional fame and was investigated by numerous witnesses. While impossible to verify details from accounts written decades later, the case became American folklore and inspired numerous books and films.",

The Warrens investigated and supported the claims. However, subsequent investigation revealed extensive evidence of fabrication: lawyer William Weber (representing Ronald DeFeo, the murderer) admitted helping the Lutzes concoct the story over wine; neighbors reported no disturbances; the Lutzes' own priest disputed their account; polygraph tests were failed or avoided; and the story changed in multiple retellings.

Multiple residents reported phenomena. Harry Price conducted extensive investigation from 1929-1938, claiming to document paranormal activity. The rectory burned down in 1939 under mysterious circumstances. However, subsequent analysis by SPR investigators revealed Price had likely exaggerated, misrepresented, and possibly fabricated evidence.
